# ðŸ“Š Understanding Kaggle Competitions with Meta Kaggle Data

This project offers a comprehensive exploration of Kaggle's evolution as a data science competition platform, using rich insights from the Meta Kaggle dataset. We examined participation trends, reward dynamics, team performance, and algorithm usage to uncover the key factors driving community engagement and success over the past decade.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Analyze trends in participation, team dynamics, and rewards across competitions
- Identify factors that influence competition success and leaderboard performance
- Visualize adoption of evaluation algorithms and programming languages
- Study community engagement via forum activity and dataset usage over time

---

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

- **Meta Kaggle Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/meta-kaggle)
- Includes data from:
  - Competitions, Datasets, Submissions, Teams
  - Forum activity (topics, messages, sentiment)
  - Kernels, evaluation metrics, tags, and organizations
- Total size: Millions of rows across over 10 tables

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Insights

### ðŸ“‰ Participation Trends
- Participation efficiency has **declined steadily since 2019**
- Competitions with **cash rewards (USD, EUR)** had the highest participation
- Community and "Getting Started" competitions attracted many users despite offering only learning-based rewards

### ðŸ‘¥ Team Dynamics & Leadership
- **High-performing team leaders** (Tier 4/5) significantly boost team rankings
- Bronze medals are most common, but **gold medal winners correlate strongly with leaderboard success**

### ðŸ§ª Evaluation Algorithms
- Algorithms like **RMSE, RÂ², NDCG, and SMAPE** have grown in use over time
- Featured competitions showed the **highest diversity** in evaluation metrics

### ðŸ“Š Programming Language Preferences
- **Python dominates** across all competition types
- R is used more in **research-focused** competitions and gains more average views but fewer votes

### ðŸ’¬ Forum Sentiment
- Sentiment analysis revealed a **positive and collaborative** tone in discussions
- Forums remain central for knowledge sharing, technical guidance, and community support

### ðŸ“¦ Dataset Engagement
- **Peak dataset views in 2020**, likely tied to pandemic-driven interest in data science
- Downloads consistently lag behind views, showing more passive interaction

---

## ðŸ“Œ Tools and Techniques

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **Tableau** and **Power BI** for dashboard creation
- **Data Modeling** using tag IDs for relational insights
- **Sentiment Analysis** using polarity and subjectivity scores
